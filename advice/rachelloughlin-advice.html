			<h4>If it's challenging, it's important and worth it!</h4>
			<p>Learning to code when you know nothing about it, can be intimidating to say the least. I had wanted to sign up for skillcrush for 3 or 4 months before I finally worked up the courage to do it. It took that long for me to realize that those fears I had of failing due to coding being too challenging, was all the more reason to dive right in.</p>

			<p>The way I see it is if there's nothing to fear and nothing to challenge you, then it must be nothing important. So because I had these fears of failing and felt challenged once I dove in, I knew I was onto something incredibly important in my life. I encourage everyone to be brave and take a chance, you could be suprised at what you can do!</p>

			<h4>Some things take patience, even at the least convenient times.</h4>
			<p>When I would get going on a project and something went wrong, I would panic and try to find the problem quickly. That was a mistake, because if anything, me rushing to find the problem delayed it being solved. </p>

			<p>When I rushed to find problems in my code, I overlooked very small, but very important parts of my code. If I had just calmy taken the time to actually go through the lines of my code and use dev tools strategically, then I would have saved a lot of time.</p>

			<p>So what I would recommend is to pay special attention to punctuation and symbols. It can be very easy to accidentally use a dash instead of an equal sign, which can make a big difference in your overall project! Also, devtools is a life saver!</p>
